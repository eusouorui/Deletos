## Get started

Being a .NET 6 Application, first of all, make sure you've got <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">.NET 6</a> installed and ready to run.

To confirm your machine's .NET version you can open your prefered console or terminal and type:
```
dotnet --version 
 ```
